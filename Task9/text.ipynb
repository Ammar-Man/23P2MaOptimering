    "Assessing Password Strength:\n",
    "Dictionary Attack: By employing a dictionary attack, one can evaluate whether users choose common and predictable passwords. If the password is found in simple dictionaries or is easily guessable, this could indicate a weakness that requires attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Brute Force: A simple brute force method can identify passwords consisting of common patterns or simple combinations, aiding in assessing the strength of selected passwords."
