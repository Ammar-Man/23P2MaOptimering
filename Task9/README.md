I'm using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a linear programming, brute force technique to create a password cracking mechanism for testing users' passwords for strength.

Both Dictionary Attack and Brute Force Password Cracking in Python:

I aim to implement both a dictionary attack and brute force password cracking in Python to provide a more comprehensive strategy for assessing password strength and enhancing the overall security of a website.

Assessing Password Strength:
Dictionary Attack: By employing a dictionary attack, one can evaluate whether users choose common and predictable passwords. If the password is found in simple dictionaries or is easily guessable, this could indicate a weakness that requires attention.

Simple Brute Force: A simple brute force method can identify passwords consisting of common patterns or simple combinations, aiding in assessing the strength of selected passwords.

This code defines a function brute_force_password_crack that generates all possible combinations of characters up to a specified length and checks if any of them match the target password.
